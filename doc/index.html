        <p>Welcome to the main page of tewi's documentation! Use the links above
        to learn more about the project.</p>

        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p>tewi is a C++14 game engine that tries to make the life
        of game developers easier: it aims to provide a somewhat easy to use
        API while maintaining some flexibility for the end-user. For example,
        the user can add their own graphics API, renderers, shader code, etc...
        <br/>
        All of this is achieved through extended use of templates.</p>

        <p>For example, there's a
        <a href="https://github.com/andry-dev/sample-plotter">
            plotter that I wrote</a> that uses tewi and implements its own graph
        renderer.</p>

        <p>As of now, it's not feature-complete. I'm planning to support
        Vulkan, software rendering and terminal rendering.</p>
